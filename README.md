The Groceries data set contains 30 days of real sale transaction data from a local grocery outlet. The data set contains 9835 transactions in sparse format with items that are aggregated to 169 categories. The dataset is part of the “arules“ package and can be loaded by calling data of Groceries.
Students will gain practical experience with mining frequent itemsets and association rules by using R to analyze the data.
